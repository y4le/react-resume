2015: I rebuilt my resume website in react for practice.

2019: added PDF version rendered from the same content.

2022: refactored and made some improvements:
 - PDF now rendered at build time rather than client side
 - order of magnitude bundle size reduction from above and switching react->preact
 - browserify->webpack to brush up on my webpack knowledge and move to a more widely used tool

2024: refactor
 - [X] convert data to yaml
 - [ ] use git submodule to hold data
 - [ ] update content with amazon work

2015: I rebuilt my resume website in react for practice.

2019: added PDF version rendered from the same content.

2022: refactored and made some improvements:
 - DONE
   - PDF now rendered at build time rather than client side
   - order of magnitude bundle size reduction from above and switching react->preact
   - browserify->webpack to brush up on my webpack knowledge and move to a more widely used tool
 - TODO
   - update content
   - books -> goodreads API
